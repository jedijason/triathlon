        This website was built using the framework Laravel 7.x. The purpose was to give
        me experience developing web applications using Laravel. 
        It also gave me experience with deploying a web project to a web
        hosting platform. 
    </p>
    <p> So far, it has been a joy to use this framework. The first version of 
        web application was built using just PHP. The difference between the two
        versions in code quality and presentation are incredible.   
    </p>
    <p>
        If you are interested in writing an application in PHP, I would recommend that
        you try this framework. It won't take you long to get a basic project created and then,
        you can evaluate if you like using it or not.
    </p>
    <p>Enjoy! Jason</p>
